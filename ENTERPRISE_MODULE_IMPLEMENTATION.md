# Enterprise Module - Implementation Summary

## What Was Built

A complete enterprise module for managing operator-based user creation with credit-based membership. The system allows:

1. **Admins** to create and manage enterprise packages (define credits and price)
2. **Admins** to approve/reject operator purchase requests and manage operators
3. **Operators** to register, login, buy packages, and create premium employee accounts
4. **Employees** created by operators automatically get 1-year premium membership

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Package Management (Admin)

- Create packages with employee/operator credits and price (USDT)
- Edit and activate/deactivate packages
- Mark packages as "popular" for display priority

### 2. Purchase Flow (Off-chain USDT)

- Operator initiates purchase with off-chain transaction ID
- Admin reviews and approves → credits granted atomically
- Admin can reject with reason
- Full audit trail of approvals

### 3. Operator Management

- Admin creates operators with email/password
- Operators can self-register via `/enterprise/operator/register`
- Operators login with email/password → JWT token returned
- Operators can be deactivated (login prevention)
- Manual credit top-up by admin

### 4. Employee Creation

- Operator uses credits to create premium employee accounts
- Atomic credit deduction (prevents double-spend)
- Employee gets:
  - `usertype=1` (premium)
  - `membertype="premium"`
  - 1-year membership (`startdate`/`enddate`)
  - `paymentBy=7` (Enterprise code)
  - Unique `freeUsername` (random 8-char hex)
  - `username` set to Telegram ID
  - JWT token for immediate login
- Membership auto-expires via existing cron job

### 5. Audit Logging

- All actions logged: package create/update, purchase create/approve/reject, operator actions, employee creation
- Actor type, action, entity type, and detailed context stored

## Database Considerations

### Indexes Created

- `EnterprisePackage`: name, status
- `EnterprisePurchase`: transactionId (unique), operator, status+createdAt
- `Operator`: email (unique), token
- `EnterpriseAudit`: actorId, entityType+entityId, createdAt

### Atomic Operations

- Credit deduction on employee creation: `OperatorModel.findByIdAndUpdate(..., { $inc: { credits: -1 } })`
- Credit addition on purchase approval: `OperatorModel.findByIdAndUpdate(..., { $inc: { credits: amount } })`
- Prevents race conditions and double-spend

---

## Membership Integration

### Created Employees

- Automatically get `paymentBy=7` (Enterprise code)
- `startdate` = today
- `enddate` = today + 1 year (employee membership is fixed to 1 year)
- Existing `Utils/membershipCron.js` handles daily expiry checks
  - No changes needed to cron
  - Expired employees reverted to `usertype=0` automatically

---

## Security Features

1. **Operator Auth**: JWT token in Authorization header
   - Token stored on Operator model
   - Validated on every protected request
   - Deactivated operators rejected at middleware level

2. **Admin Auth**: Reuses existing session-based admin auth

3. **Password Security**:
   - Hashed with bcrypt (10 salt rounds)
   - Minimum 8 characters enforced
   - Confirmation required on creation

4. **Atomic Credit Operations**: MongoDB `$inc` prevents double-spend

5. **Unique Constraints**:
   - Email: unique on Operator model
   - TransactionId: unique sparse on EnterprisePurchase
   - Username/freeUsername: application-level collision handling

---

## User Data Retrieval APIs

### Overview

Three new endpoints allow operators to view their current resources:

1. **Get Credits** - View available credits and operator slots
2. **Get Sub-Operators** - View operators created by this account (optional hierarchical structure)
3. **Get Employees** - View employees created and credit utilization

### Implementation Details

#### Get Operator Credits (GET /enterprise/operator/credits)

- Returns: `{ credits: Number, operatorSlots: Number }`
- Queries single operator document
- Use case: Display dashboard widget showing remaining credits

#### Get Operators List (GET /enterprise/operator/operators)

- Returns: Array of operators where `createdByAdmin = currentOperator._id`
- Allows hierarchical operator structure (operator creating sub-operators)
- Fields returned: name, email, credits, operatorSlots, isActive, createdAt
- Use case: Multi-level operator management

#### Get Employees List (GET /enterprise/operator/users)

- Returns: Purchase records with credit allocation details
- Calculates: Total credits used, potential users count
- Details per purchase: packageName, creditsGranted, createdAt
- Use case: Track employee creation history and credit usage
- Note: Current schema limitation - User model doesn't track creator operator
  - Future enhancement: Add `createdByOperator` field to User model for direct employee tracking

---

## Future Enhancements

1. **Payment Gateway Integration**:
   - Add Stripe/Paypal payment endpoints
   - Add webhook handlers for auto-approval
   - Store payment receipt details

2. **Email Notifications**:
   - Operator creation confirmation
   - Purchase approval notification
   - Employee account creation email with credentials

3. **Dashboard Analytics**:
   - Operator purchase history
   - Employee usage stats
   - Revenue tracking

4. **Refund/Cancellation**:
   - Handle purchase cancellations
   - Credit reversal on refunds
   - Employee account revocation policy

5. **Role-Based Operators**:
   - Add "owner" role with operator creation permissions
   - Separate permissions for package purchase vs. employee creation

---

## Notes

- All timestamps use MongoDB `timestamps: true` (createdAt, updatedAt auto-managed)
- Moment.js available in all views for date formatting
- Audit logging is comprehensive for compliance
- Payment verification is currently manual (off-chain USDT)
- Integration with existing User model seamless (no User model changes needed)
- Membership expiry handled by existing cron (no duplicate logic)
